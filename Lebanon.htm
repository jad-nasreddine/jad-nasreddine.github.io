					One year ago, the Zionist killing machine has attacked my country to revenge the 2000 defeat and to send power messages ... <br>

					One year ago, my country has witnessed one of the 21st century HOLOCAUSTS, and the world 
					was watching<br>		
					Each day we had a new genocide that your media DID NOT SHOW <br>
					Children, like yours, were KILLED or seeing death by their INNOCENT 
					eyes<br>
					Dead bodies were EVRYWHERE, and REDCROSS was forbidden to bury 
					them<br>
					More than 1200 CIVILIAN were killed (children and women in general)<br>
					Hundreds of thousand of people were HOMLESS<br>
					NO water, NO medicine, NO food, NO electricity and NO GRAVES<br>
					Our paradise was destroyed by smart bombs

				And like always we have SURVIVED<br>
				But this time we will not FORGET <br><br>
				In 33 days, the Zionist killing machine will show its non-human face for a blind world<br>
				In 33 days, Lebanese resistance will make Arab first victory on the Zionist regime <br>
				In 33 days, we will show the world how a small country can destroy the ego of a big killing machine
